# Inverter Simulation using Ngspice and ASAP-7nm </br>
### What is Ngspice ?
Ngspice is an open-source mixed-level/mixed-signal electronic circuit simulator based on SPICE3f5, a program originally developed at the University of California, Berkeley. It allows for the simulation of analog and digital electronic circuits at the transistor and system levels. Ngspice is widely used for circuit design and verification in both academic and commercial environments due to its flexibility and extensive feature set.
*Tabspace**Tabspace*Ngspice is compatible with many existing SPICE models and netlists, allowing for easy migration from other SPICE-based tools. It is also frequently updated and maintained by a community of developers, ensuring ongoing improvements and support.
